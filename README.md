#Encryptor App

##Usage
Input a message into the text box. Click "Encrypt" and you will be promped to enter a passphrase. An URL will appear in the text box. To decrypt the message, navigate to the URL, click "Decrypt" and enter the passphrase.

##Approach
This assignment was pretty much figuring out how to get the information from the user and input it into the encryptor. I tried getting mocha set up but didn't get it running all the way. Brook said that we didn't need to worry about testing so I didn't finish setting it up.
